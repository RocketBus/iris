## v1.0.7 — Datadog integration: post-launch fixes (2026-05-13)

Five fixes that landed after the v1.0.6 cut, surfaced as the customer's
real Datadog integration came online. Each one was a different layer of
the same store → read → match pipeline.

### Fixed

- **`credentials_encrypted` column type** (#44). The column was modeled
  as `BYTEA` in slice 2, but the application stored and read it as a
  base64 string from the encrypt/decrypt RPCs. supabase-js returns
  `BYTEA` as `\x<hex>` (Postgres' default escape format), which then
  broke `decode(..., 'base64')` inside `decrypt_credentials` with
  `invalid symbol "\" found while decoding base64 sequence`. Migration
  `018` switches the column to `TEXT` and recovers existing rows via
  `convert_from(..., 'UTF8')` — no reconnect required.
- **DORA event dedup before upsert + cron retries errored
  integrations** (#45). The pagination boundary event reappears on
  each iteration (§9.5 of the plan); Postgres rejects duplicate
  conflict keys *within* a single upsert with "ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE
  command cannot affect row a second time". Introduces a `uniqueByKey`
  helper and applies it to deployments, failures, and deployment
  commits. The cron also now picks up integrations in `status: 'error'`
  so transient failures self-heal on the next run instead of stalling.
- **Chunked commits lookup at the events endpoint** (#46). The
  `/api/integrations/datadog/events` route fanned out the commits
  query with a single `.in("deployment_id", ids)`. PostgREST
  serializes that into the URL; ~1000+ deploys blew past Supabase's
  proxy URL limit and the call returned 500 with no payload. Batches
  the IN clause into chunks of 100 ids.
- **Dashboard org-wide DORA was 6× inflated + per-repo DORA section
  added** (#47). The CLI fetches DORA events org-wide, so every
  per-repo payload carried the same slice of the universe under
  `dora_*` and summing across them multiplied counts by the number of
  repos that had pushed. New `platform/lib/queries/dora.ts` queries
  `external_*` tables directly; org-wide and per-repo aggregations
  differ only in whether they filter by `repository_id`. Repo detail
  page (`/[tenant]/repos/[repoName]`) gains a new `<DORARepoCard>`
  with CFR, MTTR-per-deploy, deploy frequency, lead time, rollback
  rate. MTTR-per-incident is intentionally omitted at the repo level
  because Datadog failures don't carry repository attribution.
- **CLI sends `remote_url` + cron backfills unmatched deploys** (#48).
  `_push_after_analysis` and `_run_push` both omitted the `remote_url`
  parameter when calling `push_metrics`, so `repositories.remote_url`
  stayed NULL even after `iris . --push`. Without that, the cron's
  slug match (`dd_repository_id` ↔ `remote_url`) always failed and
  every deploy landed with `repository_id = null`. The CLI now
  detects via `git remote get-url origin` and passes the URL through.
  New `rematchUnlinkedDeployments(supabase, orgId)` runs after each
  successful cron sync and retroactively fills `repository_id` on
  existing rows whose slug now resolves to a known repo.

### Chore

- **Gitignore broaden** (#43, missed by the v1.0.6 squash). The
  `supabase/.temp/` pattern only matched the repo root; the actual
  cache lives at `platform/supabase/.temp/`. Switched to
  `**/supabase/.temp/`.

No schema changes are user-visible. Upgrade path: `iris upgrade` on the
CLI, apply migration `018` on the platform's Supabase, optionally
trigger the cron manually to backfill existing unmatched rows in one
shot.

## v1.0.6 — Datadog DORA integration (2026-05-13)

Stage 3 opens: Iris can now consume a customer's DORA event stream from
Datadog and report **real** Change Failure Rate, MTTR, deploy frequency,
lead time, and rollback rate alongside the engine's commit-derived
signals. The integration is end-to-end — connect form → daily Vercel
Cron sync → engine consumption → dashboard rendering — and ships behind
an opt-in per-org connection.

### Platform — connect flow and storage

- `platform/supabase/migrations/014_org_integrations.sql` (new): one
  row per `(organization_id, provider)` with encrypted credentials
  (pgcrypto `pgp_sym_encrypt` keyed by `INTEGRATIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`),
  status, and sync bookkeeping (`last_sync_at`, `last_error`). RPCs
  `encrypt_credentials` / `decrypt_credentials` are service-role only
  and schema-qualify pgcrypto via the `extensions` schema.
- `platform/lib/encryption.ts`, `platform/lib/integrations/datadog/client.ts`
  (new): credential helpers + DORA v2 API client (validate, list
  deployments, list failures). Per-site base URL; ISO 8601 timestamps
  with the trailing `Z` form Datadog accepts.
- `app/api/organizations/[organizationId]/integrations/[provider]/route.ts`
  (new): GET / POST / DELETE for connect / status / disconnect.
  Disconnect preserves historical events; only the credentials are
  wiped.
- `app/[tenant]/settings/integrations/` (new): provider list +
  per-provider detail page with the connect form, last-sync status,
  unmatched-deployment count, "last incident registered X days ago"
  silent-decay guard, and an error-state surface when the most recent
  cron run failed.

### Platform — daily sync

- `platform/supabase/migrations/015_external_deployments.sql`,
  `016_external_deployment_commits.sql`,
  `017_external_incidents.sql` (new): persist DORA events with the
  tri-state `change_failure` column, per-deploy `recovery_time_sec`,
  remediation type, and per-commit lead-time data unpacked from
  `attributes.commits[]`. Idempotent upsert by `(provider,
  provider_event_id)`.
- `platform/lib/integrations/datadog/sync.ts` (new): per-org pipeline.
  30-day default backfill on first run, time-slicing pagination (the
  DORA v2 list endpoints have no cursor mechanism — see
  `docs/PLAN-datadog.md` §9.5), anti-spin guard for the sub-second
  co-occurrence edge case, and slug-normalized repository matching.
- `app/api/cron/sync-integrations/route.ts` (new) +
  `platform/vercel.json` `crons` entry: daily at `0 4 * * *` UTC,
  gated by `CRON_SECRET` (Bearer or `x-cron-secret` header). Iterates
  active integrations sequentially within the 300 s budget.

### Engine — DORA (real) consumption

- `iris/models/external.py`,
  `iris/analysis/dora_real.py` (new): `analyze_dora_real` computes
  CFR, MTTR per-deploy (p50/p90), MTTR per-incident (p50/p90),
  rollback rate, lead time, deploy frequency, remediation distribution,
  and (when the local commit-origin map is passed) `cfr_by_origin` /
  `rollback_rate_by_origin` plus `cfr_by_origin_coverage_pct` for
  attribution coverage. Tri-state `change_failure` handled correctly:
  `null` is excluded from the CFR denominator and surfaced as a
  separate "pending evaluation" bucket.
- `iris/metrics/aggregator.py` + `iris/models/metrics.py`: aggregator
  gains an optional `external_data` argument; eighteen new `dora_*`
  fields land on `ReportMetrics` (all optional, all stripped from the
  JSON when None).
- `iris/reports/narrative.py` + `iris/i18n.py`: descriptive findings
  for CFR, MTTR per-deploy, and rollback rate in en + pt-br.
- `iris/ingestion/external_reader.py` (new) + `iris/cli.py`: when
  the CLI is logged in to a platform, fetches events from
  `GET /api/integrations/datadog/events` before invoking the
  aggregator. Any failure (no auth, no integration, network,
  malformed) falls through with `None` — standalone `iris .` runs
  keep working unchanged.

### Platform — dashboard

- `platform/src/app/[tenant]/dashboard/sections/DORAOverview.tsx`
  (new): headline cards (CFR, MTTR per failed deploy, deploy
  frequency, lead time) with a **Datadog** badge, a fact strip
  (deploys / rollback rate / pending), and a CFR-by-origin +
  rollback-rate-by-origin correlation table. The correlation card
  stays hidden until the org has ≥ 10 failed deploys — below that the
  per-origin numbers are too noisy to attribute to AI vs human.
- `platform/lib/queries/org-summary.ts`: new `computeDORA(payloads)`
  aggregates the `dora_*` fields across repos (counts summed, CFR
  weighted by evaluated deploys, by-origin counts summed before
  recomputing the rate).
- `app/api/integrations/datadog/events/route.ts` (new): token-authed
  GET endpoint the CLI calls; returns deployments (with their
  commits) and incidents for the org window. Distinguishes "no active
  integration" (`source: null`) from "no events in window"
  (`source: "datadog"`, empty arrays).
- `platform/src/types/metrics.ts` + `platform/src/types/org-summary.ts`:
  TS mirrors of the new engine fields and the new `OrgDORA` aggregation
  type.

### Platform — operational

- `platform/next.config.ts`: the footer's build version (was showing
  "dev" everywhere since the Vercel migration) now reads from
  `package.json` with the Vercel commit SHA appended when present.

### Docs

- `docs/PLAN-datadog.md`: full design doc, including the production
  probe findings that shaped the schema (§9 onwards).
- `docs/integrations/datadog.md` (new): customer setup guide —
  Application Key scope, regional sites, connect flow, cron schedule,
  what we read / don't read, repository matching, disconnect behavior,
  and operational notes.
- `docs/METRICS.md`: full entries for every `dora_*` field, the
  tri-state semantics, the dual-MTTR rationale (per-deploy vs
  per-incident), and the module-map row for `analysis/dora_real.py`.

### Principle #2 (no individual ranking)

The integration only writes aggregates. Per-commit author emails
flowing through `external_deployment_commits` are used solely as the
join key against the engine's origin classifier; the dashboard never
surfaces them and the correlation card never breaks down below the
HUMAN / AI_ASSISTED / BOT bucket level.

Closes #15. Implemented across PRs #36 (plan), #37 (slice 1, UI
skeleton), #39 (slice 2, DB + encryption + connect), #40 (slice 3,
ingestion + cron), #41 (slice 4, engine consumption), and #42
(slice 5, dashboard + correlation + setup docs).

## v1.0.5 — Flow Efficiency: active vs wait of the PR lifecycle (2026-05-12)

### Engine

- `iris/analysis/flow_efficiency.py` (new): decomposes the merged-PR
  lifecycle into four phases (Coding, Awaiting first review, In review,
  Awaiting merge) and reports the fraction of time that was *active*
  event-driven work versus *wait* time. Heuristic for the mixed
  "In review" phase: each event (PR commits + reviews) inside the phase
  claims the next 4 h as active; intervals are unioned. Threshold is
  parametrizable and documented as a hypothesis pending calibration.
- `iris/models/pull_request.py`: introduces `CommitRef(hash,
  committed_at, authored_at)`; replaces `commit_hashes: list[str]` with
  `commit_refs: list[CommitRef]` so PR analyses can find the
  first-commit anchor without re-querying git locally.
- `iris/ingestion/github_reader.py`: extracts `committedDate` and
  `authoredDate` per commit (both already in the gh JSON output).
- `iris/metrics/aggregator.py` + `iris/models/metrics.py`: five new
  fields on `ReportMetrics` — `flow_efficiency_median`,
  `flow_efficiency_by_intent`, `flow_efficiency_by_origin`,
  `time_in_phase_median_hours`, `median_time_to_first_review_hours`.
- `iris/reports/narrative.py` + `iris/i18n.py`: three findings —
  descriptive, "wait dominates" (efficiency < 0.30), and "PRs wait Xh
  until first review" (> 24 h). Thresholds are hypotheses pending
  calibration.
- `iris/cli.py` + `iris/analysis/acceptance_rate.py`: updated to use
  `.hash` on `CommitRef`.

### Privacy (Principle #2)

- Efficiency *per PR* is computed as an intermediate but never persisted
  or surfaced — the schema and UI expose only window-level aggregates.
- `by_intent` and `by_origin` segments require at least
  `min_sample = 10` PRs; below that, the segment is omitted entirely.
- PR origin uses a ≥50% `AI_ASSISTED` commits rule with bot commits
  excluded from both numerator and denominator.

### Platform

- `platform/src/types/metrics.ts`: five new optional fields.
- `platform/src/app/[tenant]/repos/[repoName]/charts.tsx`: new
  `FlowEfficiencyCard` on the repo detail page surfacing the efficiency
  percentage and median time-to-first-review prominently, with a stacked
  horizontal bar of the five phase keys (colored active vs wait) and an
  optional by-intent breakdown.
- `platform/lib/translations.ts`: `flowEfficiency.*` strings in en-US
  and pt-BR.

### Docs

- `docs/METRICS.md`: new section 25 with the phase table, the
  active/wait heuristic, edge cases, and the Principle #2 mitigations.

Closes #17.

## v1.0.4 — Flow Load: WIP simultâneo per ISO week (2026-05-12)

### Engine

- `iris/analysis/flow_load.py` (new): counts PRs in flight per ISO week,
  segmented by intent classified from the PR title (FEATURE / FIX /
  REFACTOR / CONFIG / UNKNOWN), plus the number of *distinct* commit
  authors per week as a separate engineering-parallelism proxy. The
  author list itself is never persisted — only the count — to keep this
  aggregate from being usable to rank individuals (Principle #2).
- `iris/models/pull_request.py`: `merged_at` is now optional and the
  model gains `closed_at: datetime | None` and
  `state: Literal["open", "closed", "merged"]`. Required so we can
  represent PRs that were in flight during a window but didn't merge.
- `iris/ingestion/github_reader.py`: fetches PRs in all three states
  (merged, closed-without-merge, open) and keeps the ones whose
  lifecycle overlaps the analysis window; the previous merged-only
  scan was insufficient for WIP counting. Consumers that semantically
  require merged PRs (`pr_lifecycle`, `activity_timeline`,
  `acceptance_rate`) now filter explicitly on `state == "merged"`.
- `iris/metrics/aggregator.py` + `iris/models/metrics.py`: new
  `flow_load` field on `ReportMetrics` (list of `FlowLoadWeek`).
- `iris/reports/narrative.py` + `iris/i18n.py`: descriptive Flow Load
  finding when data exists, plus an optional feature-growth finding
  with thresholds documented as hypotheses pending calibration.

### Platform

- `platform/src/types/metrics.ts`: `FlowLoadWeek` interface +
  optional `flow_load` field.
- `platform/src/app/[tenant]/repos/[repoName]/charts.tsx`: new
  `FlowLoadCard` rendered on repo detail pages — stacked area by intent
  with `author_concurrency` as a line on a right-side axis. Visible
  only when the payload includes at least two buckets.

### Docs

- `docs/METRICS.md`: new section 24 documenting the overlap rule, edge
  cases, coverage limitations ("engineering WIP only — backlog/design/
  local-branch work do not appear"), and the privacy contract around
  `author_concurrency`.

Closes #16.

## v1.0.3 — `iris upgrade` delegates to install.sh (2026-05-12)

### Fixed

- `iris upgrade` was wired to a `${SERVER_URL}/dist/latest.txt` endpoint
  that never existed and defaulted to `http://localhost:3000` because
  it ignored `~/.iris/config.json`. Combined with a stale
  `pipx install --force` call (broken since uv started managing the
  underlying venv), the command produced "Connection refused" or a
  failed venv creation depending on the path it took.
- Rewrite the command to shell out to `curl <server>/install.sh | sh`
  using the install URL from config.json (or `IRIS_SERVER_URL`).
  install.sh is the single source of truth for version resolution,
  install-method detection, and the uninstall-then-install dance on
  pipx — duplicating that logic here drifts immediately.

---

## v1.0.2 — Per-week AI commit breakdown for /me/ai-usage trend (2026-05-12)

### Engine

- `iris/analysis/author_velocity.py`: `AuthorWeek` now carries `ai_commits`
  alongside `commits`/`lines_added`/`lines_removed`. The to_dict output
  emits it under `author_velocity.authors[].weekly[].ai_commits` so the
  platform can compute a weekly AI share per author without re-running
  origin classification client-side. Older payloads stay compatible —
  the new field is additive.

### Platform

- `/me/ai-usage` trend chart now buckets by the actual commit week
  (from `author_velocity.authors[].weekly`) instead of metric ingestion
  timestamp. A first-time `iris push` of several repos on the same day
  no longer collapses to a single point — the user's full commit
  history is plotted as soon as the engine has emitted at least two
  weeks of activity.
- After upgrading the CLI (`iris upgrade`), re-run `iris ... --push`
  on each repo to regenerate payloads with the new `ai_commits`
  per-week field. Old payloads still render commit counts; AI share
  per week is only available from v1.0.2-generated payloads onward.

---

## v1.0.1 — Fork-friendly and operator-agnostic (2026-05-11)

First patch release after the open-source debut. Decouples the CLI and platform
from Clickbus-specific branding and deployment so any organization can fork or
self-host without forking text.

### Breaking

- **Package renamed.** The Python distribution is now `iris` (was `clickbus-iris`).
  Wheels are published as `iris-X.Y.Z-py3-none-any.whl` in GitHub Releases.
  Re-install via the install script or `pip install iris`.
- **Synthetic AI co-author email domain.** Switched from `@iris.clickbus.com`
  to `@iris.invalid` (RFC 6761 reserved TLD, guaranteed never routable).
  Override with `IRIS_AGENT_EMAIL_DOMAIN` if you want a different domain.
  Legacy trailers continue to be detected by tool name (Claude / Cursor /
  Copilot / Windsurf / etc.), so existing history is not lost.

### Changed

- **Server URL is env-driven.** `iris login` and `iris upgrade` now read
  `IRIS_SERVER_URL` (default `http://localhost:3000`) instead of hard-coding
  a domain. Install scripts and platform metadata also read `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`.
- **Privacy Policy / Terms of Service are operator-parameterized.** Forks and
  self-hosters declare their legal entity via `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPERATOR_NAME`,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPERATOR_JURISDICTION`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPERATOR_PRIVACY_EMAIL`,
  and `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPERATOR_DPO_EMAIL`. Empty values render explicit
  "[not configured]" placeholders.
- **Security contact.** `SECURITY.md` and the Code of Conduct point at GitHub
  Security Advisories with optional `SECURITY_CONTACT_EMAIL` override.

### Security

- **Platform deps:** `next` bumped to 16.2.6 (resolves 13 Dependabot advisories
  including Middleware/Proxy bypasses, WebSocket SSRF, Cache Components DoS,
  Server Components DoS, RSC cache poisoning, and CSP-nonce XSS).
  `@opentelemetry/sdk-node` and `@opentelemetry/instrumentation-http` bumped
  to 0.217.0 (Prometheus exporter crash).
- **CI:** GitHub Actions bumped to current majors (`actions/checkout@v6`,
  `actions/setup-python@v6`).

## v1.0.0 — Initial open-source release (2026-05-02)

First public release of Iris under the [Apache License 2.0](LICENSE).

Iris is an engineering intelligence system that analyzes Git history to measure delivery durability and the impact of AI-assisted development. This release ships two components that version independently:

- **`iris` CLI** (`iris/`) — Python 3.11+ analysis engine. Reads commits, PRs, and code-survival data locally; produces a Markdown report plus JSON metrics. Zero external dependencies for the core path; optional OpenTelemetry export for users who opt in.
- **Iris Platform** (`platform/`) — Next.js 16 multi-tenant dashboard. Ingests metrics over a token-authenticated `/api/ingest` endpoint and surfaces cross-repo views, AI exposure, and trends.

### Key features

- **30 analysis modules** covering origin classification, intent classification, code durability (line survival via `git blame`), correction cascades, fix targeting, attribution gaps, PR insights, activity timelines, stability maps, and trend analysis
- **AI tool detection** for Claude, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf and other assistants via co-author trailers, prepare-commit-msg hooks, and velocity patterns
- **Multi-tenant platform** with GitHub OAuth, organization mirroring of GitHub orgs, and per-org Row-Level Security
- **i18n support** in en-US, pt-BR, and es-ES (with automatic detection via cookie + `Accept-Language`)
- **Apache 2.0 license** — permissive, includes patent grant, allows commercial reuse including SaaS

### What this release explicitly does NOT include

By design (see [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) and [`docs/PRINCIPLES.md`](docs/PRINCIPLES.md)):

- No individual developer ranking, scoring, or productivity tracking
- No real-time monitoring or live alerts
- No IDE plugins or vendor-specific AI telemetry
- No telemetry by default — `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is opt-in (see [`docs/TELEMETRY.md`](docs/TELEMETRY.md))
