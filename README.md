# Iris

**Engineering intelligence for the AI era.**

Iris analyzes Git repositories and generates impact reports that measure the ratio between **durable delivery** (signal) and **corrective effort** (noise) in software engineering — with specific focus on how AI tools change that ratio.

---

## What It Does

Iris reads repository history, classifies commits by intent and origin, analyzes PR lifecycle, and produces a comprehensive report answering:

- Is AI-assisted code more durable or more disposable?
- Which areas of the codebase are stable vs constantly churning?
- What caused destabilization — and when did it start?
- Are code reviews catching issues or rubber-stamping?
- Where is AI being used but not attributed?

### Validated on Real Data

Tested on an organization with 58 repositories, 3,497 commits, and 1,211 PRs:

- AI-assisted code stabilizes at **79%** vs **64%** for human code
- **45%** of "human" commits match high-velocity patterns (unattributed AI)
- Automated coupling detection found 4 messaging client implementations that always change together
- Weekly timeline with pattern detection explained destabilization causes

---

## Quick Start

### One-line install

The install scripts are served by your Iris deployment (the value of `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`). Replace `<your-iris-deployment>` with that URL:

```bash
# macOS / Linux / WSL
curl -fsSL <your-iris-deployment>/install.sh | sh

# Windows PowerShell
irm <your-iris-deployment>/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer:

1. Checks for Python 3.11+ and Git
2. Creates a dedicated venv at `~/.iris/venv` (no system conflicts)
3. Installs Iris and creates a `iris` wrapper at `~/.local/bin/iris`
4. Adds `~/.local/bin` to your PATH (zshrc/bashrc or Windows user PATH)
5. Uses `pipx` if available (preferred for isolation)

**Environment variables:**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `IRIS_HOME` | `~/.iris` | Installation directory |
| `IRIS_VERSION` | `latest` | Specific version to install (e.g. `1.1.2`) |
| `IRIS_INSTALL_METHOD` | `auto` | Force `pip` or `pipx` |

**Uninstall:**

```bash
iris uninstall                      # recommended (cleans PATH entries too)
rm -rf ~/.iris ~/.local/bin/iris  # manual — macOS / Linux / WSL
```

### Manual install (development)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:RocketBus/clickbus-iris.git iris
cd iris
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

Requirements: **Python 3.11+**, **Git**. Optional: **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** for PR analysis. Zero external dependencies.

### Single Repository

```bash
iris /path/to/repo
iris /path/to/repo --trend              # with 30d vs 90d trend analysis
iris /path/to/repo --lang pt-br         # Portuguese report
```

### Organization (all repos)

```bash
iris --org /path/to/org-directory
iris --org /path/to/org-directory --trend --repos repo1,repo2
```

### AI Attribution Hook

```bash
iris hook install /path/to/repo         # install prepare-commit-msg hook
iris hook status /path/to/repo          # check installation
iris hook uninstall /path/to/repo       # remove hook
```

The hook detects `$CLAUDE_CODE`, `$AI_AGENT`, `$CURSOR_SESSION`, `$WINDSURF_SESSION` and adds a `Co-Authored-By` tag before the commit is created. No history rewriting.

### PR Analysis

```bash
iris pr                    # analyze PR for current branch (auto-detect)
iris pr 42                 # analyze specific PR
iris pr 42 --comment       # post insights as a PR comment
iris pr --no-context       # skip repo history (faster, fewer insights)
```

Generates concise markdown insights for code review:
- **Composition** — how many commits are AI-assisted, which tools
- **Churn context** — files in this PR that are actively churning
- **Cascade risk** — files recently part of correction cascades
- **Size & concentration** — large PR warnings, directory focus

Requires `gh` CLI installed and authenticated.

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--days` | 90 | Analysis window in days |
| `--churn-days` | 14 | Churn detection window in days |
| `--out` | `out/` | Output directory |
| `--lang` | `en` | Report language (`en`, `pt-br`) |
| `--trend` | off | Enable trend analysis (recent vs baseline) |
| `--recent-days` | 30 | Recent window for trend analysis |
| `--repos` | all | Comma-separated repo filter (org mode only) |

### Output

```
out/90d/
  org-repo-report.md       # Full Markdown report
  org-repo-metrics.json    # Machine-readable metrics
  org-name-org-report.md   # Organization report (org mode)
  org-name-org-metrics.json
```

## Report Sections

A single repo report includes (all sections are conditional — only appear when data is sufficient):

| Section | What It Shows |
|---|---|
| **Key Findings** | 3-5 executive bullet points with systemic context |
| **Metrics Summary** | Commits, reverts, churn, stabilization |
| **Engineering Behavior** | Intent distribution: feature, fix, refactor, config |
| **Stability by Change Type** | Stabilization per intent |
| **AI Impact** | Stabilization, churn by origin (Human vs AI-Assisted) |
| **Commit Shape** | Structural profile by origin (focused, spread, bulk, surgical) |
| **Code Durability — Time to Rework** | Median rework latency by origin |
| **Code Durability — Line Survival** | % of introduced lines still at HEAD, via git blame |

    Report[Markdown report<br/>+ JSON metrics]
    Plat[Iris platform<br/>Next.js]

    CLI -.->|optional &mdash;&nbsp;iris push| Plat

```

The CLI is the engine: read-only on the working copy, deterministic Markdown + JSON output, runs entirely offline. The platform is optional — it ingests the same metrics over a token-authenticated `/api/ingest` endpoint and surfaces cross-repo views and trends. The two ship and version independently.

## Principles

1. **Measure systems, never individuals** — Iris analyzes repositories and teams, not developers.
2. **Metrics are hypotheses** — All values are experimental and evolve with observation.
3. **Explain why, not just what** — Churn chains, coupling, and timelines explain causes.
4. **Attribution without accusation** — Flag patterns, never claim certainty about AI usage.
5. **Simplicity first** — Scripts over frameworks, zero external dependencies, deterministic output.

---

## Status

**Stage 0: Signal Discovery — Complete.**

15 analysis modules validated on real organizational data. Entering Stage 1: Attribution & Adoption.

---

## Privacy

The CLI runs entirely on your machine. No telemetry is sent unless you explicitly opt in by setting `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and pointing it at your own OpenTelemetry collector. See [`docs/TELEMETRY.md`](docs/TELEMETRY.md) for what is and isn't collected, and how to enable / disable.

The hosted platform deploys are internal-access. Authentication is via GitHub OAuth; no source code is uploaded — only the metrics produced by the CLI.
