        whatIsTitle: "¿Qué mide Iris?",
        whatIsAnswer:
          "Iris analiza tu historial de Git para revelar señales de calidad de entrega: estabilización, durabilidad del código, cascadas de corrección, brechas de atribución e impacto de la IA. Los reportes son puntuales, no monitoreo en vivo.",
        howWorksTitle: "¿Cómo funciona el análisis?",
        howWorksAnswer:
          "Ejecuta la CLI en cualquier repo. Lee commits, PRs y datos de supervivencia de código localmente, y genera un reporte Markdown + métricas JSON. El motor no depende de servicios en la nube.",
        aiToolsTitle: "¿Qué herramientas de IA detecta?",
        aiToolsAnswer:
          "Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Windsurf y otros asistentes se detectan vía metadatos de commits, trailers de co-autor y patrones de velocidad. Se pueden agregar herramientas nuevas vía hook prepare-commit-msg.",
        privacyTitle: "¿Iris lee mi código?",
        privacyAnswer:
          "El motor corre localmente y solo inspecciona metadatos de Git y diffs. Nada sale de tu máquina, salvo que conectes la plataforma en la nube opcional para agregación entre repos.",
        individualsTitle: "¿Hace ranking o score de devs?",
        individualsAnswer:
          "No. Iris está diseñado explícitamente para analizar sistemas, nunca individuos. No hay ranking de productividad, leaderboard por autor, ni score individual.",
        platformTitle: "¿Qué agrega la plataforma en la nube?",
        platformAnswer:
          "La plataforma agrega métricas entre repos y a lo largo del tiempo, ofrece dashboards a nivel de organización, detección de cambios y comparación entre repos. La CLI por sí sola es totalmente usable sin ella.",
        installTitle: "¿Cómo instalo?",
        installAnswer:
          "Ejecuta el script de instalación (curl -fsSL {appUrl}/install.sh | sh) o pipx install iris. Requiere Python 3.11+ y Git.",
        priceTitle: "¿Cuánto cuesta?",
        priceAnswer:
          "La CLI es gratuita y open source. La plataforma en la nube está en acceso anticipado con precio por uso — contáctanos para más detalles.",
        contributeTitle: "¿Cómo puedo contribuir o reportar problemas?",
        contributeAnswer:
          "El proyecto está en GitHub en RocketBus/clickbus-iris. Issues y PRs son bienvenidos.",
